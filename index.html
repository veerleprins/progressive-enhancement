          <h2>What is progressive enhancement?</h2>
          <p>
            The web is filled with websites for all sorts of subjects and goals;
            web shops to buy clothes, information sites for writing research
            papers, cooking blogs for following recipes and many more. These
            websites should be accessible to everyone, no matter what situation
            they are in. For this we use progressive enhancement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Progressive enhancement</span> is an approach to ensure that
            the basic functionality is accessible to everyone but where the
            experience improves layer by layer. A good way to explain
            progressive enhancement is by eating a cake:
          </p>
        </section>

        <article>
          <section>
            <div>
              <h3>Functional / Reliable core (Base cake)</h3>
              <p>
                The functional goal of this dry cake is to be eaten and this
                should always be achievable. It doesn't taste great and it's not
                the most amazing experience to eat this dry cake, but the idea
                of 'cake' is there and you can eat it.
              </p>
            </div>
            <aside>
              <img
                src="assets/images/basic-cake.svg"
                alt="Image of a basic cake."
              />
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>
              <h3>Usable (Frosting)</h3>
              <p>
                The frosting that has been added makes the cake less dry and
                therefore easier (and even a little bit tastier) to eat. The
                cake is now more usable for eating and therefore the experience
                of eating a cake increases.
              </p>
              <i>*Unnecessary for eating the cake</i>
            </div>
            <aside>

                alt="Image of a decorated cake"
              />
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <div>
              <h3>Pleasurable (Candles/Toppings)</h3>
              <p>
                The final step is the ultimate user experience. The user
                experience increases because happy toppings have been added, new
                flavors are added and because candles can now be blown out. This
                is why it is more fun and tastier to eat this cake.

          The frosting and the candles both create a more fun and enjoyable
          experience, but neither of these are necessary to achieve the goal of
          eating a piece of cake.

          <h2>Cake and websites... ?</h2>
          <p>
            HTML creates content and structure. With paragraphes, headers and
            links you can give a website content. It is important that the key
            features of the website are created in the HTML. This means that
            text and images should be written straight into the HTML instead of
            being injected with javascript. It is also important to use the
            correct tags; headers should go into a H1, H2, H3 etcetera. Content
            like a navigation, a link and a footer all have specific elements
            that can be used to make the userâ€™s experience as pleasant as
            possible. Using these correct tags also benefits screen readers
            greatly.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS makes the website pleasant to look at, whether with some nice
            styling or by making the website responsive. It is important that
            CSS does not add any key features, only additions. This is because,
            for example a screen reader, can not convey the styling to a user
            who is blind. Yes, CSS can give many great additions to a website
            nowadays, with responsive styling, grid layouts, dark or light theme
            detection and many more incredible features. But these should and
            can not be used for key features that will help the user reach their
            goal.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is almost unimaginable, a website without JavaScript. Yet there
            are still many cases where JavaScript can simply not be used. Think
            of older browsers, bad internet connections, old and lesser quality
            devices. In these circumstances, JavaScript files will often either
            not be loaded as they should or not be loaded at all. This is why it
            is important to not add any important features with javascript, you
            could potentially lock a lot of people out of your website by
            accident.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Why is progressive enhancement so important?</h2>
          <p>
            Progressive enhancement is not just useful for people with a
            permanent disability, it can help a lot of people with their
            experience on your website. For example, someone with a broken
            dominant arm will have to use the keyboard to navigate a hospital
            website to book an appointment, a user with bad internet might still
            want to look at a news website, a user who lost their glasses might
            need a high contrast or a zoom function to be able to order new
            glasses and a driver might need to have as little distractions as
            possible when looking for an address. These people are often few but
            does that mean that we should exclude them completely? Of course
            not. This is why progressive enhancement is so important, users
            should be able to use a website no matter what specific situation
            they are currently in.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>How do you work with progressive enhancement in your mind?</h2>
          <p>
            So how do you build a progressive enhanced website? You start off
            with your basic HTML; text in the corresponding HTML tags, forms in
            pure HTML and a navigation for ease of use. Once the HTML is
            finished, the website should be fully usable to reach a goal. Now
            this experience does not have to be ideal, you will likely have to
            substitute certain features only usable with Javascript for
            alternatives. With progressive enhancement, you aim for the best
            possible experience with what is available. The next step to
            creating a progressively enhanced website is adding CSS. CSS
            supports quite a lot of handy media queries which can greatly help
            with building a progressively enhanced website. For example, you can
            adjust your website for people who wish to have reduced motion due
            to epilepsy or for people who wish to view the web with a higher
            contract due to difficulty with reading. These and a lot of other
            media queries help greatly with creating a progressively enhanced
            website. Once again, at this point your website should be fully
            usable to reach a goal. Finally, you can add JavaScript to add final
            additions to your website to enhance the userâ€™s experience.
